# Pf2ools Papers

This repository stores the (sometimes quasi-formal) write-ups that are sporadically written for the Pf2ools project. The aim is to avoid these documents being spread across file-hosters and Discord messages, and instead collect them into one place for later reference. It is oriented towards **contributing developers**, and assumes a reasonable familiarity with the project's particulars.

## Format

Although the structure, tone, and content of each document is left to the discretion of the author, the following guidelines are recommended:

- Documents are contained within the `documents/` directory.
- Documents are numbered sequentially in order of publication.
- Filenames are written as `PP<number>; <title>`.
- The title, author, and date should be written at the top of each document.
- Edits, outside typo-corrections, should be avoided for continuity.
- Documents should either be plaintext (`.txt`) or Markdown (`.md`) files.

## Legal

All documents are licensed under the [MIT license](./LICENSE).
